- 👋 **I am Harshith**, a shadow in the world of code.  
- 👀 **I seek knowledge**, much like the Uchiha, with a focus on perfecting my craft and mastering new techniques.  
- 🌱 **I am always learning**, honing my skills in web development, and walking the path of improvement.  
- 🤝 **I wish to collaborate**, but only with those who seek true mastery in their work.  
- 📫 **To reach me**: Through the quiet, still night, email me at **harshith.ituc@gmail.com**.
