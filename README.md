👋 I am @ItachiPrime, a shadow in the world of code.
👀 I seek knowledge, much like the Uchiha, with a focus on perfecting my craft and mastering new techniques.
🌱 I am always learning, honing my skills in web development, and walking the path of improvement.
💞️ I wish to collaborate, but only with those who seek true mastery in their work.
📫 To reach me: Through the quiet, still night, email me at harshith.ituc@gmail.com.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him—like the Uchiha, my actions speak louder than words.
⚡ Fun fact: Like Itachi’s Sharingan, I see code in ways others do not, and my journey is ever-evolving.
